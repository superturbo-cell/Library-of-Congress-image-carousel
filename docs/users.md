# User Guide
This project remixes Library of Congress information into a carousel based on a search term input. The project uses Python to construct a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) Application that is then formatted  into classes with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/). 

# User
- Library workers or Archivists who develop discovery tools for their institution's digital collections.
- Code that can be used with the API systems of shared archival and digital collections to retrieve information in an alternative view. 

 # API use
 This project was developed on a [Library of Congress API]([url](https://www.loc.gov/apis/json-and-yaml/)) that can be used without a key. 

 # User Steps
## Create the Requests for the Library of Congress API
-- import requests
-- Define Search Parameters
-- Make the Request
-- Check the Response and add in additinoal information.

## Create a a Flask App
--Import Flask 


•	Describe how to use your project (preferably using screenshots), walking through it from a end user's perspective, step - by step, in a logical order.
•	If possible make a note on possible errors (i.e. messages that the user might get) and how to fix those.
•	If your project provides code that is meant for other programmers to use (i.e. provides some sort of API), this user's guide can simply be a quick intro on how to get started programming with it using several examples, rising in complexity. Anything more technical should be put into the developer's documentation.
•	Mention any caveats, things currently not implemented or not working as intended, bugs or any other limitations (having these is fine and no reason to feel bad!) Again, keep it simple here and put notes about more complex issues and limitations into the developer's documentation instead.
The easiest way to edit your project's ReadMe.md it is via github's in-browser markdown editorLinks to an external site. (which has a preview and images/videos can just drag/dropped in!). Here's an intro to writing Markdown "code"Links to an external site.. 
You could even create and embed a GIF animation:
•	https://dev.to/alenaniku/make-your-readme-better-with-images-and-gifs-1k60Links to an external site.
•	https://dev.to/kelli/demo-your-app-in-your-github-readme-with-an-animated-gif-2o3cLinks to an external site.
Note to students using only jupyter notebooks: Make sure that the final notebook contains a working run through all the cells, so that a visitor can see (in github) what's happening in your notebook and what cool graphs, etc. it can generate.
Note that I may subtract points for missing or wrong content or for bad/missing markdown formatting. I will tell you what's missing, incomplete or wrong and it's up to you to fix these issues and then leave a comment that you've fixed things so that I get a note about this. Alternatively you can also email me.
