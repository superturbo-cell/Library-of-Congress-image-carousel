# External documentation (i.e. the developer's guide)#
This project remixes Library of Congress information into a carousel based on a search term input. The project uses Python to construct a Flask Application that is then formatted  into classes with Bootstrap 5. 

# User
- Library workers or Archivists who develop discovery tools for their institution's digital collections.
- Code that can be used with the API systems of shared archival and digital collections to retrieve information in an alternative view. 
 
# Install 
Use pip to install third party packages [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/url) and [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

# User Flow
â€¢	Known Issues: You should mention any issues you know about (or suspect)

# Future Work
- Using this carousel with other API content
- Spacing the captions beneath the images for more clear reading.
- Linking the images back to the original catalog record for more information
- Applying a secondary filter or more clear display pattern for the results.
