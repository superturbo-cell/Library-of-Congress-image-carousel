# External documentation (i.e. the developer's guide)#
This project remixes Library of Congress information into a carousel based on a search term input. The project uses Python to construct a Flask Application that is then formatted  into classes with Bootstrap 5. 

# User
- Library workers or Archivists who develop discovery tools for their institution's digital collections.
- Code that can be used with the API systems of shared archival and digital collections to retrieve information in an alternative view. 
 
# Install 
Use pip to install third party packages [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/url) and [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

•	(End) User interaction and flow through your code ("walkthrough")
•	Known Issues: You should mention any issues you know about (or suspect)
•	Future Work
•	I suggest that you again use github to create a markdown file, as you did with the ReadeMe.md
•	Note: like for the User's guide I may subtract points for missing or wrong content or for bad/missing markdown formatting. I will tell you what's missing, incomplete or wrong and it's up to you to fix these issues and then leave a comment that you've fixed things so that I get a note about this. Alternatively you can also email me.
•	Put the dev guide into the doc folder of your project and only hand in the URL to the doc.
